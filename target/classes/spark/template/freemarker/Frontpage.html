        <p>This is a website dedicated to ease the painful and long process of applying
        for low income housing. The ultimate goal of this website is for people to 
        fill out one form online here, rather than having to find multiple forms 
        and deliver in person to various town and state agencies. While this is still in development, 
        and not all information required is gathered, it is a very valid prototype and representation
        of the final product.</p>
